# Assignment 2

## Purpose
Full description of the application domain, including a clear statement of the overall purpose of the Mining exercise that you have performed.


## Data
A description of the data set that you targeted, together with any transformations that were required to pre-process the data for the Mining exercise. Ensure that you present samples of both raw data and pre-processed data.

### The Dataset
### Preprocessing


## Chosen Algorithms
An explanation of how your selected Mining algorithms work (no more than a page for each algorithm). Your description of algorithms should not just be a passive description of how the algorithms work but should also include an examination of its strengths and limitations.

### Selection of Algorithms
A rationale (justification) for selecting the algorithms (you must select at least three, at least one of which must be an algorithm not covered in the lecture course), together with your reasons for rejecting the other algorithms that you initially considered. Note that your justifications can cite literature as supporting evidence but these must be backed up by your own reasoning.

## Performance of the Models
Detailed experimental study of the performance of the selected Mining algorithms on your selected data set. Include actual outputs from your Mining software as supporting evidence. You will need to give your own definition of “performance” which may include a variety of factors. Your performance measures must take into account aspects of accuracy and time.

### Cost of Experimentation
In your experimental study you should run several different experiments that will consist of various combinations of algorithms, and pre-processing methods (e.g. different methods of feature selection, different combinations of parameter values). For example, if you experiment with a different algorithms, f different feature selection methods and p different sets of parameter values and b different boosting methods then you will run a total of t=a*f*p*b different experiments. The number t can be quite large depending on your choice of a, f, p and b. Thus, as part of your report you will need to produce an experimental plan describing what strategy you used to keep the total number of experiments down to a manageable number whilst not sacrificing performance.

### The Winner
An analytical (this can include statistical methods) comparison of the performance of the algorithms, together with an explanation of the superior

performance of the winner. You may use the Experimenter module in Weka for this purpose. Your analysis should also include suitable visualizations (model diagrams, PRC curves, whatever is appropriate) that compare the performances of your winner and runner-up algorithms. Your winner should then be compared to any significant (data mining) work previously undertaken on the data set you selected (if any). In your experimental study you will have defined a number of different performance measures and these measures should (a) be used on their own and (b) combined into a single measure. To combine several measures into one use a linear weighted model, with weights to be supplied by yourself, backed up by suitable justification.
